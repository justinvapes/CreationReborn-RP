        <strong><span style="color:#33ffff;">2.0 In-Character Gaming</span></strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <font color="#00ff00"><strong>2.1</strong></span> Failure to RP is strictly forbidden, stay in character at all times. When rules are broken RP first, report later. Scream "fail RP" and you will be banned.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.1a</strong></span> Roll with it. You won't always win. You won't always be revived. Try to add to a story, not just "win". 
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.2</strong></span> 2 character limit. 3 characters if you are a Gold Subscriber, If first is Police, second may NOT be a major crime figure, you will be removed from PD.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.2a</strong></span> Value your in-game life. Don't punch on with someone if they have a gun pointed at you, however, you can defend yourself if get an opportunity to pull your own gun, but be realistic, pulling your gun out while a gun is pointed to you is not a value of life.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.3</strong></span> RP realistic driving. If you crash into a wall doing 100 kph, you CANNOT continue to drive, even if the car still works.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.4</strong></span> Don't enter other people’s RP. Example: Don't run into a bank robbery with full police perimeter to use an ATM. No excuses. Don't engage in hostile RP without a valid RP reason.
        <br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.5</strong></span> Traffic stops by police are NOT classed as a declaration and you cannot shoot at police, it is only a declaration when the player engages in an active pursuit/ evade with police.
        <br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.5a</strong></span> Combat Logging: Don't log or use commands to avoid RP consequences, such as death, jail, robbery, hostage etc. Admins can see when your game crashes or you log out, You will be banned no questions asked.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.6</strong></span> Power Gaming: Is NOT allowed to gain advantage, example: creating something that isnt there like a bomb strapped to someones body, if its not in the game then it doesnt exsist and cant be used in roleplay. Use /me very carefully when using it in RP, Example: /me "eats cyanide pill" is power gaming.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.7</strong></span> Character Switching: There is a 30 minute cooldown after a situation before you can relog and change characters, If you are in an RP situation and you drop connection you MUST come back as the same character to finish the RP, if you are caught relogging to change characters mid RP, you will be banned, no excuses, this also includes using the in game plastic surgeon to change your characters appearance, this is only to be used when not in an RP situation.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.8</strong></span> Pulling a gun from a vehicle must be done from a car that you own or stole, you cannot pull your weapon out of a randomly parked car.
		<br /><span style="color:#00ff00;"><strong>2.9</strong></span>  You can only have 1 whitelisted job per person not per character, for example you cannot be a Mechanic on character 1 and a cop or car dealer on character 2, the only exception is emergency services, you may be cop on character 1 and EMS on character 2.

		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>3.2</b></font> When hostage, if captor takes phone do not "metagame". Mute yourself on TS etc, don't use chat. If sneakily using radio/phone use your in game mic at the same time so your captor has a chance of overhearing you.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>3.3</b></font> Police : RP that your tracker is removed, police cannot use the tracker info if another officer has been taken hostage, dont even look at your map.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>3.4</b></font> Hostage situation involves twitter talk and holding someone for ransom and does require police on be on duty, this is NOT the same as a kidnapping.

    <p>
        <strong><span style="color:#33ffff;">6.0 Deathmatching, RDM & VDM and Declaring</span></strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <font color="#00ff00"><b>6.1</b></font> RDM : Not allowed. “Random Deathmatching” : Deliberately killing people without warning or valid RP reason, or inciting conflict purely to result in combat.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>6.1a</b></font> KOS : There is NO kill on site, Every situation must be declared with the exception of 7/11 robberies, robbing the store is auto dec, this does not mean you HAVE to shoot.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>6.2</b></font> VDM : Not allowed.  “Vehicle Deathmatching" Using vehicles to kill, ram, troll. Includes causing death "accidentally" by losing control of your vehicle.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>6.3</b></font> Declaring : Required. Giving someone forewarning that they are engaged in hostile RP.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>6.3a</b></font> Decs *must* be by voice only or by aiming your gun at another player, not tweet, phone, /ooc, etc. The only exception is for robbery/hostage RP, where you may tweet/phone police etc.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>6.3b</b></font> Being followed by someone while on duty as roadworker or auspost etc, is an act of declaration and you may defend yourself if necessary, use common sense when doing so, a car simply turning up behind you at a set of lights is not an excuse to pop them in the head, you know if your being followed and about to get robbed.
    </p>
	
	<p>
        <strong><span style="color:#33ffff;">***DECLERATION*** Example: If you are seen using a firearm and/or pointing it at someone you have now just declared on them and/or their crew/group Police may intervene if you have pointed your gun and/or fired shots at another civilian, 
shooting someone's car or property is also classed as a declaration, If you decide you want to return fire be prepared to go to prison unless you have a legitimate for self defense but remember you still should NOT be carrying a firearm.
Pointing your gun at someone first means you or your crew/friends CANNOT be the first one that shoots.</span></strong>

    <p>
        <font color="#00ff00"><b>7.1</b></font> There is NO NLR here. In game you "wake up at hospital" after major trauma and remember what happened to you if you choose.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>7.1a</b></font> NLR *DOES* apply only to hostage RP, Bank Robberies and executions for that scenario only. Neither civs nor police may return to the scene or carry over knowledge of suspects from these incidents if they have died. Exception : Being medically treated/revived by paramedics.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>7.2</b></font> You may take revenge on people that kill you, but only once, must be declared.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>7.3</b></font> Decs do not carry over to a new life.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>7.4</b></font> Admin revives: Admins will not revive just because there is no Police or EMS, if you crash your bike speeding or get shot or beat up by an NPC, you must RP this, Admins will only revive for RDM, VDM or glitch causing death, Admins can see this.

		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>8.3</b></font> City laws contain gang-specific legislation re search powers.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>8.4</b></font> Emergency services may wait to secure a scene before saving you.
		<br /><font color="#00ff00"><b>8.5</b></font> Staff may suspend any/all gangs for any/all time if RP standards are not being met.

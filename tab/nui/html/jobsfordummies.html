Use discord, and please see the following list of resources and information.<br />
	</b></font>
</p>
<p>
	<br /><strong><span style="color:#00ffff;">Note:</span> </strong>"File a ticket" means log a ticket using our system located in the menu up top, under Helpdesk  &gt; File Help Ticket. You will be presented with various categories you can file your issue under. Login as per normal forum details. You may need to provide some information such as steamid, email, etc.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color:#00ffff;">Note:</span> </strong>Reports are taken very seriously. Investigations can require time and effort, as a result if proven to be lying to gain advantage you may be permanently banned from all AGRP platforms. <br />
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="color:#00ffff;">Note:</span></strong> If you are unsure, at any time you can post in this forum or on #helpdesk in discord to ask a question or be directed to the appropriate avenue. 
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#33ff00;"><strong>For supporter packages or any financial inquiries:</strong></span> Soon we will have packages and information available in a store module. NOT before launch. For further pre-purchase question you will be able to join the teamspeak helpdesk or post in #helpdesk on discord. For issues with your account, modifying packages, refunds, detail updates etc please file a ticket in the relevant category.
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#33ff00;"><strong>For Bug Reports and Compensation Requests:</strong></span> Check the "Bug Report" forum to see if this is a known issue. If not, file a ticket.
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#33ff00;"><strong>Clarify a server rule or city law, or if an action breaches them:</span></strong> Use the #helpdesk channel on discord, or post here. We are open to suggested changes and discussion.
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#33ff00;"><strong>Report rule breaking or abuse by a player:</span></strong> Join the "helpesk" channel on TS to speak to a staff member in private. If staff are not available feel free to leave a message in the #helpdesk discord. Finally if staff are unavailable, please file a ticket. Generally speaking evidence (video recording) is very useful to prove or defend allegations.
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#33ff00;"><strong>Report a staff member :</strong></span> If you feel a staff member has made an incorrect decision, or been abusive, or any other complaint please file a ticket using the "report staff" category. ONLY Managers and above will be able to view these, not admins or general support staff. 
</p>
<p>
	<span style="color:#33ff00;"><strong>To dispute a ban:</span></strong> Please make a post in the ban appeals forum. Appeals must be submitted by the banned player only. Note all ban disputes are public, and will remain public. If you try to bullshit staff you will be publicly called out, all available evidence including logs and/or video will be posted, and your ban may be extended. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="color:#33ff00;">How do I apply for police, ambulance, to own a business, etc?</span></strong>  See the "forms" button in the top menu bar of the forum, or the "Applications" forum down the bottom.</a> Note inquiring in RP isn't the worst idea, but you may simply be directed to the online application process. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="color:#00ff00;">How do I apply to work at an existing business?</span> </strong> Speak to the relevant business owner. In RP scores brownie points.
